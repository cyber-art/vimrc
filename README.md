# vimrc
Vim Configuration for my personal use



For minimal installiation of this vim configuration, i.e. for python and c/c++ languages configuration only, run install.sh:

> bash install.sh

For complete installiation of this vim configuration, i.e for python, go, rust, js, npm, java, c/c++/c# languages configurations, run install-all.sh:

> bash install-all.sh

For custom choices, you have to run corresponding bash files individually. For all of bash files, firstly the compiler of the chosen language will be installed, and then the ycm-core for vim will be installed.

That's all. 

Enjoy using this vim configuration.

**NOTE:** You can change colorscheme by using the colorschemes given in the colors folder.
